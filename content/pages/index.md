## Typical use cases

*   **Developing** landing pages or prototypes (`npm run dev`).
*   **Exporting** carefully compiled and formated files for collaboration (`npm run export`).
*   **Building** the final (production) bundle, ready for deployment (`npm run deploy`).

When you want to build whole web sites from the data sources as API or many markdown files, go with Static Page Generators (SGC). For example [Gridsome](https://gridsome.org/) (VueJS), [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) (React) or [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) (Go) will work for you much better.

## Features

*   **SEO-friendly** — Open Graph and Twiter Cards markup, self/canonical.
*   **User-friendly** — image optimizations, favicons, webmanifest and all sources minification to smallest bundle.
*   **Developer-friendly** — [ESLint](https://eslint.org/), [Prettier](https://prettier.io/), [Remark](https://remark.js.org/), [Stylelint](https://stylelint.io/) via tasks or with [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) and [Lint staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged).
*   Separate tasks for Development, Export and Build with automatic renaming and hashing all critical assets.
*   Ready for implementation Git based CMS as [Forestry.io](https://forestry.io/) or [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) etc. — Front Matter (Markdown files metadata and content).
*   HTML temlates uses [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/). Fully customisable [Bootstrap 5.1.x](https://getbootstrap.com/) extended with [BEM](https://en.bem.info/). JavaScript processed with [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) or injected from CDN or as static files.

**Usefull scripts**

*   Deploy to FTP (`npm run deploy-ftp`) or Netlify etc.
*   Validating output HTML (`npm run build:validate:html` or `npm run export:validate:html`).
*   Listing all TODO’s (`npm run todo:show`).
